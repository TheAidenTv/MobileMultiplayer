# MobileMultiplayer

A simple test of multiplayer controls on a mobile device. I call this a game when there is no * * real objective * * however it is still cool to join in a world with friends, have different player models and jump around the map.

Now that I have done this test of a game, I can use a lot of these assets and scripts to construct a real game whenever I get a good idea.
